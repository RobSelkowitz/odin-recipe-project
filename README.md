# odin-recipe-project
My First Odin Project

This project should be a way to build some basic html and git skills.  I will fill out the README further along with thoughts and reflections.

Notes after completing the basic project: 

This is a Simpson's themed recipe set, filled with references to the show. 
I've noticed/done a few things working on this:
1. I don't like the default width of text in paragraphs.  I'll adjust that in the CSS activities later on.
2. I am not sure how I feel about vs code's autofill features.  I need to play more.
3. I want to think about width formatting of text in vs code for readability.
4. It's a conscious effort to remember to do atomic commits at this point.
5. I added a "return to main page" link on each recipe for improved navigation.  I didn't like not having that.
6. Before completing the next stage (adding CSS) I should look at best practices for README files.
