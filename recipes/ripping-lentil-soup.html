    <p>
        This classic dish combines the delightful tang of cranberries, 
        the sweetness of sugar, and the jiggle of pectin.  You, of
        course, need not worry yourself with any of the messy details.  
        It's a recipe any pre-teen <em> can </em> handle.
    </p>
    <h3> You'll need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> One can jellied-style cranberry sauce</li>
        <li> Can opener</li>
        <li> Rimmed serving plate</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Open one end of the can with the can opener</li>
        <li> Gently slide cranberry sauce onto serving plate.  Expect 
             satisfying <em>pop and plop</em> sounds as the sauce exits 
             the can </li>
        <li> Present with a flourish and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Pro Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Just stick it in the refrigerator until ready to serve. The 
             dish will retain it's signature tube shape longer.
        </li>
        <li> Puncture the underside of the can before opening the lid makes
            it easier to pour out the sauce.  But you lose the <em> pop and 
            plop</em> effect.
        </li>
    </ul>
